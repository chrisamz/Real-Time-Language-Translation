# Real-Time Language Translation

## Description

The Real-Time Language Translation project aims to build a scalable system for real-time language translation using instruction-finetuned language models. This project focuses on leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques and deep learning models to provide accurate and efficient translations in various languages.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Natural Language Processing:** Implementing NLP techniques for language understanding and translation.
- **Real-Time Translation:** Developing systems that can perform translations in real-time.
- **Deep Learning:** Utilizing deep learning frameworks and techniques to train and deploy language models.

## Use Cases

- **Multilingual Customer Support:** Providing real-time translation for customer support in multiple languages.
- **International Business Communication:** Facilitating communication between business partners speaking different languages.
- **Education:** Assisting in multilingual education by providing real-time translations of instructional materials.

## Components

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing

Collect and preprocess text data to ensure it is clean, consistent, and ready for training.

- **Data Sources:** Multilingual text datasets, translation corpora.
- **Techniques Used:** Data cleaning, tokenization, normalization, augmentation.

### 2. Language Model Training

Develop and train language models for translation.

- **Techniques Used:** Instruction-finetuning, transfer learning, sequence-to-sequence models.
- **Libraries/Tools:** Hugging Face Transformers, TensorFlow, PyTorch.

### 3. Real-Time Translation System

Implement a scalable system for real-time translation.

- **Techniques Used:** API development, real-time processing, load balancing.
- **Libraries/Tools:** Flask, FastAPI, Docker, Kubernetes.

### 4. Model Evaluation

Evaluate the performance of the language models using appropriate metrics.

- **Metrics Used:** BLEU score, ROUGE score, METEOR score.
- **Libraries/Tools:** NumPy, pandas, nltk, sacreBLEU.

### 5. Deployment

Deploy the real-time translation system for live use.

- **Tools Used:** Flask, Docker, Kubernetes, Cloud Services (AWS/GCP/Azure).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or above
- Required libraries listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real_time_language_translation.git
   cd real_time_language_translation
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Data Preparation

1. Place raw text data files in the `data/raw/` directory.
2. Run the data preprocessing script to prepare the data:
   ```bash
   python src/data_preprocessing.py
   ```

### Running the Notebooks

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Open and run the notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to preprocess data, develop language models, evaluate models, and implement real-time translation:
   - `data_preprocessing.ipynb`
   - `model_training.ipynb`
   - `model_evaluation.ipynb`
   - `real_time_translation.ipynb`

### Model Training and Evaluation

1. Train the language models:
   ```bash
   python src/model_training.py --train
   ```

2. Evaluate the models:
   ```bash
   python src/model_evaluation.py --evaluate
   ```

### Deployment
